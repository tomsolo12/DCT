🔧 1. Stability, Performance & Error Handling
 Improve schema scan performance

Add loading indicators, pagination on large schema loads

Throttle metadata polling

 Error handling across all modules

Try/catch for all fetch/DB operations

Display user-friendly error messages for failed scans, queries, etc.

 Query execution timeouts

Set a max execution time for SQL queries

Return clear timeout errors

🧠 2. Rule Builder Improvements (Data Quality)
 Add rule presets/templates

Non-null

Email format

Value range

Regex pattern

 Sample data preview when building/editing a rule

Fetch 10 random rows from the table/field during rule creation

Show which values would fail the rule

 Test Rule mode (before saving)

Option to preview results of a rule against a selected table

🧩 3. Issue Management Workflow
 Create basic issue entity/model

Fields: issue_id, rule_id, table_name, status, assignee, comments[]

 Build “Issue Tracker” tab

Table view: issue ID | rule violated | table | status | date | assigned to

Status filter (Open, In Progress, Resolved)

 Add comments panel for each issue

Simple textarea + timestamped comments

💬 4. AI Assistant Improvements
 Improve query context awareness

Add dropdown for user to select the table or field they're querying

Use this to refine prompt passed to OpenAI

 Add query explanation popup

Tooltip or modal that explains the logic of generated SQL

 Build a “Query Template Gallery”

Categories: Aggregation, Joins, Filters, Time Series

Allow user to one-click insert templates into the editor

🔐 5. RBAC & Role UI Enhancements
 Create role selector in user management UI (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

 On frontend, conditionally disable/hide UI components based on role

 Restrict actions in backend based on role level (middleware check)

🛠️ 6. Admin Panel & Monitoring
 Build “Admin Panel” screen

List of sources, rules, users, last sync time, total issues

Add “Force Sync” and “Deactivate Source” actions

 Add system activity log (basic audit trail)

Record events like: rule created, source added, query executed

Display in a scrollable list with filters

⚙️ 7. System Optimization & Deployment Readiness
 Enable connection pooling to avoid hammering DB

 Add a central config file for managing DB credentials (dotenv or secrets)

 Implement result pagination on large query result sets

 Refactor backend routes into modular structure (API folder per feature)

📘 8. Documentation & Help
 Add inline help tooltips for all rule types

 Create a “Getting Started” panel/page
